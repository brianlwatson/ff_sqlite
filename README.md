Updated ESPN FF scraper using sqlite (not functional while ESPN fantasy football is out of season)

**We will try to add the usage and a description on here of what each stat does

Ideas for statistics to compute:
  Completely optimized lineups (actual scores) - and how many wins/losses gained
  Optimized lineup with 1 player swap - and how many wins/losses gained
  
  Exceeded Expectations (How much did a player exceed projections in total over the season)
    Top 20 and bottom 20
  
  Added value (Top 20 players that outperformed the starters of the same position on average for the whole season)
    Ex: So if I had Russell Wilson, how many points above the average starting QB did he gain for me (cumulative)
    This would be done for each position

  Most worthless players
    Ex: Opposite of the above
    
  Teams that were most touchdown dependent
  Players that scored the highest % of their points off of TDs (minimum 50 carries/catches/passes?)
    Ex: What % of a player's points were scored off of TDs (remember Passing TDs != Receiving and Rushing TDs)
    
  How many points did teams get off of their drafted players (when started)
    This can be any player that was on the roster in week 1
    
  How many points did teams get off of their free agent acquisitions
